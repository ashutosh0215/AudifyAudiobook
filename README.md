# Audify - An AudioBook App

Welcome to the Audify repository! This repository contains a JavaScript application for mobile devices built using React Native. This README provides instructions on how to set up the development environment and run the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:


1. Install Node.js LTS: If you haven't already, download and install Node.js LTS. This provides the necessary JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.

2. Install Expo CLI: Expo CLI is used to manage your React Native projects. Install it globally using npm:

```sh
npm install -g expo-cli
```

3. Install Expo Go: Download the Expo Go app from your device's app store (iOS or Android).

4. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine:

5. Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your working directory to the project's root folder:

```sh
cd AudifyProject
```

6. Install Dependencies: Install all the necessary dependencies for the application. This command will install the dependencies listed in the package.json file:

```sh
npm install
```

7. Start the Expo Development Server: Launch the Expo development server:

```sh
npx expo start
```
8. Testing with Expo Go: Use the Expo Go app on your mobile device to scan the QR code provided by the Expo development server. This will allow you to run and test the application on your device.

That's it! You should now have the Audify app up and running on your mobile device for testing and development.
